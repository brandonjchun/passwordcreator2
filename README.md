# passwordcreator2

An interactive program designed to guide people to making a safe and secure password, with options like pseudorandomization and password length selection given to the user. Run PasswordRunner2 to begin! :)

# What I Learned
• Class hierarchy (Inheritance, Abstraction, Accessing class attributes)

• Data validation (Reading input, Checking input, Case and switch statements)

• Operation logic (Reprompting user until correct input is received, Program runs until all conditons are met)
