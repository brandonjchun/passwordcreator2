# passwordcreator2

An interactive program designed to guide people to making a safe and secure password, with options like pseudorandomization and password length selection given to the user. Run PasswordRunner2 to begin! :)

# What I Learned
• Class hiearchy (Inheritance, Abstraction, Accessing class attributes)

• Data validation (Reading input, Checking input, Wwitch statements)

• Program process (Reprompting user until correct input is received)
