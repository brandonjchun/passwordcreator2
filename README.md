# passwordcreator2

This project was created to guide people to making a safe and secure password, with pseudorandomization and password length selection given to the user.
This project is also interactive, with many edge cases tested to ensure the user has a positive experience. 
Run PasswordRunner2 to begin, and the automated messages given by the bot will give instructions on how to use the program.
